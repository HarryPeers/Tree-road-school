When new students arrive at Tree Road School, they are assigned:<br>
- a unique ID number<br>
- a tutor group<br>
- a unique school email address<br><br>
A tutor group contains approximately 25 male and female students.<br>
Mr Leeman is a form tutor and wants a simple computer system to manage his tutor group.<br>
Mr Leeman wants to be able to have a user friendly interface that allows him to log into the system and
carry out the necessary administration.<br><br>
The details of the students that Mr Leeman needs are:<br>
- unique ID number<br>

- forename<br>
- date of birth<br>
- home address<br>
- home phone number<br>
- gender<br>
- tutor group<br>

Analyse the requirements for this system and design, develop, test and evaluate a program that allows<br>
Mr Leeman to:<br>
1. log in with a username and password<br>
2. access a menu system<br>
3. enter and store the students details<br>
4. log out<br>
5. retrieve and display the details of any student when Mr Leeman enters the studentâ€™s unique ID
number.<br>
